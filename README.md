# C++ Pointers and Classes Trying-out

This repository is dedicated to experimenting with and learning about pointers and classes in C++. It contains various test files that demonstrate different concepts and functionalities related to these topics. Still working on my way to get familiar with C++ :D

## Files and Folders

There are folders 'Class' and 'Pointer' containing all the testing files. The files includes everything that I have explored and tested-out typically when learning pointers and classes in C++. There is also a very simple library management project that I tried out.
